# Fylo landing page with two column layout

This is built with the basics of Typescript in React.

## Form Email interface

This is what I've come up with as my first interface. I tried creating a dynamic input fields but my knowledge still not enough, so maybe I could try it in the future or so.

```
interface FormEmailInterface {
	labelTxt: string;
	inputNameID: string;
	inputClasses: string;
	inputPlaceholder: string;
	btnTxt: string;
	btnClasses: string;
}
```
